# NotchStats

**NotchStats** is a sleek, minimalistic app that makes the most of your Mac’s notch! It provides quick access to key system stats and a personalized note, displaying:

- **CPU Usage**
- **Memory Usage**
- **Your Name**
- **Custom Note** (from a file - great for reminders or anything you'd like!)

Simply hover over the notch area to reveal these stats, and they’ll disappear as soon as you move your mouse away. Perfect for a quick glance without cluttering your workspace.
